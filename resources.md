### Topics
The subjects that can be studied may vary in difficulty, from fundamental to advanced. Here are a few instances of study topics:
<ul>
     <li>An introduction to a topic not covered in the mentee's program.</li>
     <li>An in-depth reading of a theorem or set of theorems.</li>
     <li>A more advanced treatment of a standard topic.</li>
     <li>Reading of a research paper.</li>
</ul>

### Final Project
The final project should be a tangible product that motivates and demonstrates what the mentee learns throughout the reading course. Here are some ideas:
<ul>
    <li>Write a 5 page expository paper (Spanish or English) of your topic.</li>
    <li>Develop an implementation of your topic using Python, Mathematica, Macaulay2, Sage, etc.</li>
</ul>

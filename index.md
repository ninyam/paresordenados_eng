<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>
<strong>Pares Ordenados</strong> is an online <a href="{{ '/info' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Directed Reading Program (DRP)</a> in Spanish, i.e. it is a mathematics mentorship program, pairing undergraduate students with graduate student mentors, or early carrear mathematicians, for a semester-long reading project.
</p>
</div>

### WHO?
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>
<strong>Pares Ordenados</strong> especially aims to provide such mentorship to Latinx math students around the world from underrepresented groups or non-traditional backgrounds, as well as to students at non-research oriented colleges and universities.
</p>
</div>

### WHEN?
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>
The Fall 2023 edition will run from <b>September 4, 2023</b> to <b>December 15, 2023</b>.

### HOW?
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p><strong>Ordered Pairs</strong> takes place online.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Undergraduate students apply to be mentees. See <a href="{{ '/mentees' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Mentees</a>.</li>

	<li>Graduate students, or early carrear mathematicians apply to be mentors. See <a href="{{ '/mentores' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Mentors</a>.</li>

	<li>Mentees and mentors are paired based on mutual interests. Each pair decides on a topic for the semester. See examples of topics in <a href="{{ '/recursos' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Resources</a> or in <a href="{{ '/editions' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Editions</a>.</li>

	<li>Each ordered pair <b>(mentor, mentee)</b> meets online for <b>one hour weekly</b>.</li>

	<li>Halfway through the semester, each pair decides on a final project and writes a project description that must be sent to the organizers. See examples of projects in <a href="{{ '/recursos' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Resources</a> or in <a href="{{ '/editions' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Editions</a>.</li>

	<li>At the end of the semester, there is a meeting where all mentees give short presentations about their topics.</li>
